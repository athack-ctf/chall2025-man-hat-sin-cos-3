    Before leaving Dr. Dexter's office you hear a notification sound coming from his computer. You look at the screen and notice an intriguing message.

    You will know once you find the flag. This is an OSINT challenge; you will need to do some digging to find the flag. You will know once you find it (it follows the full ATHACK syntax).

    **Hint 1**: any information you find interesting is important and will lead you to the flag if you consider it wisely

    **Hint 2**: sharp deductive skills and patience are key 

    **Hint 3**: no special characters

    **NOTE**: the flag format is `ATHACKCTF{_}` where `_` is the name of the place.
